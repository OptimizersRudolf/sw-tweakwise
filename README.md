## About this extension
This extension is still in development. I will add more and more features over time.
At the moment the following features are supported:

### Feed
- Fully customizable product feed which out-of-the-box gives you a valid feed for Tweakwise (multi-channel, multi-language)
- Advanced pricing
- Variants

### JavaScript implementation
- Instant search
- Suggestions (including search phrases, categories and facets)
- Merchandise
- Recommendations (featured products and cross-selling)

_All features are tested on a default Shopware 6.4 and 6.5 installation and in a real-life webshop._
