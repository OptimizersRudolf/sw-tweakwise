## About this extension
This extension is still in development. I will add more and more features over time.
At the moment the following features are supported:

### Feed
- Fully customizable product feed which out-of-the-box gives you a valid feed for Tweakwise (multi-channel, multi-language)
- Advanced pricing
- Variants

### JavaScript implementation
- Instant search
- Suggestions (including search phrases, categories and facets)
- Merchandise

_All features are tested on a default Shopware 6.4 and 6.5 installation and in a real-life webshop._

## Changelog
Do you want an overview of all changes in the past versions? Just have a look at the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Roadmap
Tweakwise offers a lot of really nice features. Those features don't work out-of-the-box on your site
and therefor those features needs to be integrated into the extension. I don't have an exact roadmap 
at the moment, but things you can expect are:

- **Basic JavaScript implementation** so you can be up-and-running in a matter of minutes
- With the **Standard Site Search based on the API** you will be able to use Tweakwise without the need to include the JavaScript library of Tweakwise. 
- The **Autocomplete** feature will also be included.

If you want a specific feature in the extension which is not (yet) implemented, please [reach out](mailto:support@richardhaeser.com) and I can make a proposal to get it
in as soon as possible.
