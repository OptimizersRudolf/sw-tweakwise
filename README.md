## About this extension
This extension is still in development. I will add more and more features over time.
At the moment the following features are supported:

- Fully customizable product feed which out-of-the-box gives you a valid feed for Tweakwise

_All features are tested on a default Shopware 6 installation and in a real-life webshop_

## Roadmap
Tweakwise offers a lot of really nice features. Those features don't work out-of-the-box on your site
and therefor those features needs to be integrated into the extension. I don't have an exact roadmap 
at the moment, but things you can expect are:

- **Basic JavaScript implementation** so you can be up-and-running in a matter of minutes
- With the **Standard Site Search based on the API** you will be able to use Tweakwise without the need to include the JavaScript library of Tweakwise. 
- The **Autocomplete** feature will also be included.

## Demo
You can find an implementation of the latest version on https://www.driekleinehaasjes.nl.

## Support
This is an opensource extension and the development of this extension is on a voluntary basis. Therefor I can't provide you
free support. Luckily there are some possibilities to get the most out of the extension.
