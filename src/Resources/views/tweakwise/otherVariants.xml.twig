{#
    This file is rendered for every variant product and can be used to add
    custom properties of a variant which are not handled automatically. You
    don't have to add stock, options and properties of a variant as those
    are done automatically.

    You can also use this template to add logic to the data of a variant.
    In that case, just override the variantAttributes.xml.twig with an empty
    file and add all data in this template. This can be useful, for example,
    if you only want to add data from variants that are in stock.

    You have the variable variant available in this template with all options
    and properties.
